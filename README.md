# Clean-StreetView
A small google chrome extension that removes as much of the on screen navigation as it can so you can take 'clean' screen shots. 

This was inspired by Karl Hodges Medium post [Take better Google Street View screenshots](https://medium.com/@karlhodge/take-better-google-street-view-screenshots-e8b025861756)

As Karl notes, screen grabs of Google Street view are used by journalists to illustrate stories when your "editor wants you to publish fifty-eight pieces of content every day and wonâ€™t let you leave your desk". But the results often look messy when they include the navigation and other user interface elements that StreetView plasters over the content. 

This Extension takes the user interface CSS that Karl identifies and turns it off with a cick of the icon. 

## Making it work.
1. Download the [cleanstreetview.zip](cleanstreetview.zip) file from here. 
2. Unzip it somewhere on your computer.
3. In Google Chrome visit chrome://extensions
4. Drag and drop the unzipped folder on to the page. A new icon should appear in the tool bar. 
5. Navigate to google maps and choose a location in street view. Karl has some good tips for setting up the right 'shot' in his post. 
6. Once you're happy, click the Clean StreetView icon and the UI should dissapear. 
7. Go full screen or take your screen shot in the usual way

If you want to get the navigation back, just refresh the page.
